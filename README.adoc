= Grails 3 / AngularJS 2

NOTE: This application is a proof of concept and a work in progress.

A few things to keep in mind:

1. The TypeScript compilation works but right now is still slow (I'll be working to improve this).
2. Angular2 is currently in alpha and is a moving target and things might not work as expected.

== The Application

This is a simple hello world application written in Angular2. It should provide a nice starting point for experimentation.

Take a look at `grails-app/assets/typescript/app.ts` and `grails-app/views/index.gsp`.

== The Tools

This application makes use of the following projects:

* https://github.com/craigburke/bower-installer-gradle[Bower Installer Gradle] (for client side dependencies)
* https://github.com/craigburke/typescript-asset-pipeline[TypeScript Asset Pipeline]
